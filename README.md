# openSASUKE
This project can be described in these words;
A Simulator for the niche-hit sports-reality show variably called "SASUKE" or "Ninja Warrior.", being an alternative to "Ninja Machine."

This simulator, in contrast to NM, is fully FOSS, and highly customizable. It is also *natively* compatible with ANY operating system that has Python 3.1 or above, whereas NM is only natively compatible with Windows.
It uses .yaml files for the storage of competitor and obstacle files.
This project is authored by Cain, with the help of whomever decides to contribute.

This project was born out of personal wants to be able to use custom obstacles in Ninja Machine, which apparently is not a possibility at this time.
This project is ***NOT*** meant as "adversarial" competition, rather, NM and oS could be used for different things; openSASUKE could be better for custom competitions, NM could be better for leagues.

Please read EVERY file that has "README" in it before using, contributing to, or otherwise interacting with this program, or inquiring with me about the program.
